**Fixed:** August 25, 2025  
**Issue:** Lost aesthetic and frontend UI  
**Resolution:** Restored beautiful Bootstrap-based design

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Solution**
Completely rewrote `index.html` to:

- ✅ **Beautiful hero section** with gradient backgrounds and animations
- ✅ **Professional stats section** with hover effects and icons
